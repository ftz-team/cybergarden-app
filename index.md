## Musorok - the closest solution



### About

Not everyone in our country knows how important it is to recycle the garbage, and those who know still do not have a convenient tool to get information about the collection sites. How to solve this problem? This question has puzzled our team on one of the recent hackathons.

We have developed a service in which partners magazines can post information about garbage collection points. The store places a collection point and rewards, for example, with a discount on the goods of the user who uses the point.

**Why would a magazine place a garbage collection point?**
- Attracting new customers
- Support for eco-movements

**Users advantages?**
- Motivation to engage in environmental activities
- Convenient service with garbage collection points nearby
